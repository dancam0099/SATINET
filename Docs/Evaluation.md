# Evaluation

This script can be used to evaluate the performance of the different stereo matching methods being adopted.
One can run the matching script using the following command

```console
./evaluation.py -k ./Data/Iarpa/groundtruth/Challenge1.kml -t ./Data/Iarpa/groundtruth/Challenge1_Lidar.xyz -r ./Results/S2P/
```

The *k* attribute specifies the path to the *Challenge1.kml* file while the *t* attribute specifies the path to the *Challenge1_Lidar.xyz* data that is included in the challenge.
The *r* attribute specifies the folder containing data generated by the *matching.py* script as results which are being compared to the Lidar data here.
