# Installation

Set up a virtual environment
```console
python3 -m venv satinet-venv
```
Initialize the virtual environment using

```console
source satinet-venv/bin/activate
```

# TODO List
I need to fork to the s2p library from https://github.com/cmla/s2p.git - I need Johann's help on setting this up so that I can edit changes to the forked s2p repository.
I need to fork to the mccnn library from https://github.com/Jackie-Chou/MC-CNN-python.git - this needs to be extensively updated including the conversion from python2 to python3. Again I need Johann's help to setup the fork.
